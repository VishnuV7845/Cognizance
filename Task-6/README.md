# Task 6 Part-2

## Theme 
### The webpage is based off of an online book club tht I'd like to work on creating sometime. The website wil bring together people who read books, and will serve as a place for them to read and discuss together.

## Motivation
### I have loved reading books from Grade 9,but it could be hard to actually discuss them, or even find people to read together with, when all of your friends are not even interested. So, I thought, why not an online place for such people to come together and do something that they love? An Onine Book Club I am in with my online friends on Discord might also be a part in all this. 

## Future improvements
* ### A "contact us" button at the top ribbon
* ### A dedicated place for the monthly book club reads
* ### An improved news feed
* ### Better alignment of elements on the landing page
* ### Improving overall design
